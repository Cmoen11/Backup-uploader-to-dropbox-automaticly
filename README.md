# Backup files to dropbox using python automaticly

Smal little handy script that take advantage of the dropbox module to upload one or multiple files onto dropbox. 

I made this because I wanted to get my backup sql files uploaded to dropbox to ensure that I do not lose them, I figure that someone may have use for it also, so feel free to take and edit it as you need to make it work for you! 

It will also sort the files into directories for you.


## install
pip install dropbox <br>
pip install schedule

install the python file into the directory with the files you wish to be uploaded.
Edit the file to fit your files.
